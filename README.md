- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Kolt45Tech
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Arduino, automation, and basic coding projects. I also enjoy mathmatics (specifically probability and stats) 
and learning about how they can be incorporated into my projects.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning arduino and python and am still getting the hang of github.
